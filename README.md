# DiffusionApiClient

This project is a small client UI and micro-backend for utilizes the prodia.com stable diffusion API to generate images.

## Usage Instructions

Prerequisites:

* Node
* .NET SDK 7.0

If you do not have these install them first.

1. clone the repository
2. navigate into the cloned directory
3. `cd ng-client`
4. `npm i`
5. `npm run build`
6. `npm run pub`
5. `cd ..`
6. `dotnet build`
7. `dotnet run`

If the process worked you should now have the following files:

* `<ProdiaClient.Host>/wwwroot` should contain the files from building the angular app.
* a new file named `prodia.db` in the root folder
* a new empty folder named `ImageCache`

While the CLI app is running open your browser at http://localhost:4949 and you should see the ProdiaClient.

## Api Key

You need an API Key from Prodia to use the client. Navigate to Prodia.com to create an account and get your API key.
Once done copy the api key into the ApiKey input at http://localhost:4949/configuration

    Note you only have to do this once, as the configuration will be saved to the prodia.db file.

## Notes

Images generated by Prodia will be saved to your `ImageCache` folder. Find them there later even when the App is not
running.

**Renaming Images**

The app uses the image's file names to find the associated metadata such as the prompt, therefore you should only rename
images through the interface.
